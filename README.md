# Recipe-Book

# Overview
As a Software Engineer student, I'm striving to be continously learning and improving. In pursuit of my passion for cooking and commitment to healthy eating, I've developed a digital recipe book application called "GlutenFreeChef." GlutenFreeChef offers a comprehensive collection of nutritious and flavorful recipes tailored for individuals following a gluten-free diet. The purpose of GlutenFreeChef is to provide celiac individuals and those interested in healthy eating with a convenient platform to discover, save, and prepare wholesome meals that align with their dietary preferences and requirements.

# Development Environment
GlutenFreeChef was developed using a range of tools and technologies to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient recipe management system. The development environment includes:

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code
- Frontend Framework: React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface
- Backend Framework: (I don't know if I should use Node.js) for server-side logic and API development
Database: SQL for storing recipe data securely
The programming languages utilized in this project include JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.
